# css-chat: CSS only web chat

This is an implementation of a chat website that uses no JavaScript, instead
relying only on HTML and CSS to run the frontend.
 
It is based entirely on
[css-only-chat](https://github.com/kkuchta/css-only-chat) by
[kkuchta](https://github.com/kkuchta) and adds nothing new (in fact, it's
probably lacking several things).

I wrote this quickly in 2019 for fun and haven't touched it since.
